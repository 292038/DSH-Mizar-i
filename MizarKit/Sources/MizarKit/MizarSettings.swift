//  What the operator has switched on, and where that is remembered.
//
//  Two rules shape this file.
//
//  **It is a value.** The whole of the app's preference state is one `struct`
//  with value semantics, so a test can hold two of them and compare, and the
//  store that owns the live one has exactly one place to persist from. The
//  alternative -- a `Bool` per switch scattered across the app -- is how a
//  switch ends up meaning one thing on the screen it is drawn on and another
//  where it is consulted.
//
//  **The decision is here, not in the view.** Which notification a push is, and
//  whether the operator wants it, are both answerable without UIKit, without a
//  notification centre and without a running app. That is the point: the screen
//  that draws the switches can only be as trustworthy as the function underneath
//  them, and this one is testable in a second with `swift test`.
