//  RelayIdentity.swift
//  MizarKit
//
//  Who a relayed request is from.
//
//  The relay meters traffic per identity — the account behind a session, or the
//  install when there is no account — and it reads that identity from two headers
//  on the request before the request is forwarded:
//
//    x-mizar-client-id   an install id, `[A-Za-z0-9._-]{8,64}`
//    x-mizar-account     SHA-256 of the account bearer token, 64 lowercase hex
//
//  Deliberately *not* the token itself. The relay needs a stable label for a
//  bucket in its traffic table, not a credential it could replay: a hash gives it
//  the label and gives a leaked relay log nothing it can authenticate with. The
//  client id is not a secret either, for the same reason — it names an install,
//  and the relay never treats it as proof of anything.
//
//  The paid relay is the exception, and it is a narrow one: it has to know
//  whether the account is paying, and only the token can answer that. So a third
//  header — `x-mizar-session`, built by ``sessionHeaders`` — goes to that host
//  and no other. It is stripped by the relay before replay, exactly like the
//  other two, so the computer still never sees any of them.
//
//  All three are stripped from the request before it is replayed upstream and
//  from the WebSocket upgrade headers, so a host never sees them. This type only
//  produces them; where they are attached is the connection's business.
