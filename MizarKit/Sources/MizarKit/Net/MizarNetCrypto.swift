//
//  The handshake and the per-packet seal.
//
//  The design is a stripped-down Noise IK with identities the pairing
//  already established:
//
//    - both sides hold a static Ed25519 identity (``MizarNetIdentity``),
//      derived from the host secret or the device token — the same trust
//      the pairing code created, carried into the direct path;
//    - both sides generate a fresh X25519 ephemeral per connection and
//      *sign* it with the static identity, so a peer that answers is
//      provably the endpoint the ticket named, and an impersonator cannot
//      produce the signature;
//    - the session keys come from the ephemeral-ephemeral shared secret
//      through HKDF, one key per direction, salted with a hash of the two
//      endpoint ids — so the session is bound to *these two* peers, and a
//      reflected transcript from another connection does not decrypt;
//    - every post-handshake packet is sealed with ChaCha20-Poly1305 under
//      a nonce derived from its packet number, with the packet header as
//      authenticated data — the QUIC packet-protection idea, minus the
//      header-protection layer this deployment does not need.
//
//  Ephemeral keys mean forward secrecy: a stolen identity key does not
//  decrypt a recorded session. Signing them means no unauthenticated
//  Diffie-Hellman: the man-in-the-middle that a bare ECDH would allow is
//  exactly what the signature closes.
