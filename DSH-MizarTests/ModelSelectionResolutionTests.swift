//  Which model the composer bar names, and which one the picker says is in
//  force.
//
//  The bug these pin: after a switch, the button in the composer (not the sheet
//  it opens) kept naming the model the session had been on before the switch.
//  The bar read only the host's stats frame, and nothing refreshes that frame
//  on an idle session, while the picker read the switch this phone had had
//  accepted -- so the two named different models, and the button was the wrong
//  one. `agreedModelSelection` is now the single precedence both read; the
//  source contract keeps a future edit from splitting them again.
