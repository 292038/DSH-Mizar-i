//  The composer's model pill and context ring, labelled and compact.
//
//  `AppFlowTests.testTheComposerBarShowsTheModelContextAndCommands` launches the
//  app and drives it into a session to assert three buttons exist and that the
//  context figure is the host's number. The pill's label composition and the
//  ring's static drawing are the parts a snapshot can own; the identifiers are
//  pinned against `ComposerBar.swift` so the buttons stay addressable for the
//  tests that still need the running app.
