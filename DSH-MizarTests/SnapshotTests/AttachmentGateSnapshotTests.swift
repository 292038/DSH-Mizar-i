//
//  AttachmentGateSnapshotTests.swift
//  DSH-MizarTests
//
//  The composer's attachment controls in both gate states: the two buttons
//  open for a paid account, and the same two buttons with the lock footer for
//  a signed-out one. These are the states
//  `AccountUITests.testAttachmentsUnlockForPaidAccounts` and
//  `testAttachmentsAreLockedForSignedOutAccounts` each launch the app and walk
//  a sign-in + redeem chain to reach.
//
//  `CommandList` is the view the buttons actually live in -- `ComposerBar`
//  builds it for the composer's "+" control -- and it takes the gate as a
//  plain `Bool`, so both states render from fixtures. The identifier contract
//  pins the three `composer.attach.*` identifiers in the app source. The gate
//  *rule* itself -- account plan to unlock -- is `AppModel
//  .advancedFeaturesUnlocked` in the app target, so no unit test covers it
//  here; the UI test keeps owning that half until the rule moves where a unit
//  test can reach it (docs/phase2-triage.md, the :247 row).
//
//  The titles resolve through the app bundle in the simulator's own language,
//  so the references are pinned by recording on the canonical English-locale
//  simulator (`Mizar Runs`, `AppleLanguages = en-US`), per docs/snapshots.md.
